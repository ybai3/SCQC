\title{Genewise screening
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{Gene-wise screening is based on the expectation that for a gene with a low technical noise, a geneâ€™s count in a library will tend to increase with the increase of library size, which was tested using negative binomial regression of gene count (as dependent variable) against library size (as independent variable). We kept only those genes achieving a significant (FDR>0.10), positive regression coefficient.
